## üìã Starting OpenWashData Package Review

**Package**: `$PACKAGE_NAME`
**Review Type**: Comprehensive R Data Package Review
**Workflow**: PLAN ‚Üí CREATE ‚Üí TEST ‚Üí DEPLOY

### üîç PLAN Phase - Initial Analysis

I'll now analyze the `$PACKAGE_NAME` package structure and create a review plan.

#### Step 1: Package Structure Analysis
- [ ] Checking package directory structure
- [ ] Verifying washr template compliance
- [ ] Identifying missing components

- Raw data preservation

**Issue #4: Documentation**
- README.Rmd structure and content
- Function documentation
- _pkgdown.yml configuration
- Variable dictionary

**Issue #5: Tests & CI/CD**
- R-CMD-check workflow
- Package checks status
- Example code execution
- Build process

### üìä Initial Findings

*[Present summary of findings]*

### ‚úÖ Ready to Proceed?

The PLAN phase is complete. I've identified [X] issues that need attention.

**Would you like me to proceed to the CREATE phase?**

- `gh issue develop 1` - Create branch for issue
- `git checkout 1-general-information-metadata`

**Planned changes:**
*[List specific changes]*

**Proceed with these changes?** (yes/no)

After implementation:
- `gh pr create --title "Fix general information & metadata" --body "Implements #1"`

*[Continue pattern for each issue...]*

## üß™ TEST Phase

Running comprehensive package checks using commands from CLAUDE.md:
- `R -e "devtools::check()"` - Run R CMD check
- `R CMD build .` - Build package
- `R -e "pkgdown::build_site()"` - Build website
- `R -e "devtools::test()"` - Run all tests

**Test Results:**
*[Show results]*
